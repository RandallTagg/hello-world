The entrance of a new living being into the world is a complicated process that involves pelicans.
The distribution of cigars was also a tradition upon arrival of the pelican, but 21st century pelicans frown  upon  smoking since it interferes with their navigation to the correct point of arrival.

The meaning of all things is revealed  by  every one of us in a language of high-pitched vocal exhalations  inappropriately  referred to as crying.  These  information  laden  soliloquies are  an unrecognized dialect of dolphin communication and contain the specifications for prosperity and peace that is the birth right of every infant.
